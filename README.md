Currently I am a full-time student at SFU in Computing Science. I have come to learn about swift problem solving and 
critical through my work in retail and as a sailing instructor. I have always had a love and passion for sailing and 
have used that to achieve my role as Senior Sailing Instructor at Eagle Harbour Yacht Club. In my free time I enjoy 
playing pool and ping pong with my roommates and friends and have recently taken an interest in golf, going to the 
driving range with my roommate multiple times a week.
